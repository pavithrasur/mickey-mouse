            Today we will read about Disney’s Mickey Mouse Clubhouse story “Look Before You Leap” by Sheila 
            <br>Sweeny Higginson. The book is illustrated by the Disney Storybook Artists and designed by Elizabeth 
            <br>Andaluz. Let’s dive right into this Mickey Mouse short story.</p>
            <h2>Look Before You Leap</h2>
            <p>This Mickey Mouse funny story begins with Mickey Mouse and Goofy playing a game of chess. Right
               <br>when Mickey was about to make his move, something jumped in from the window and landed right in the 
               <br>middle of the chessboard. Both Mickey and Goofy hadn’t seen what had jumped in, so Mickey asked 
               <br>Goofy “what was that?”. After looking at it carefully, they saw something green on the chessboard with a 
               <br>pair of eyes looking back at them. It said “ribbit, ribbit” and had webbed green feet. It was a frog! <br><br><img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/08/19/550x309/Mickey_Mouse_Clubhouse_1692419482480_1692419492273.jpg"
                alt="pic2" height="250px" width="280px">

                <br>The frog started jumping around the room and Goofy tried to catch it. It jumped out of Goofy’s hand and 
                <br>landed on the silly switch. The silly switch is a device that makes everyone and even the house act funny 
                <br>when turned on. Suddenly, because of the silly switch, the room began to spin around. Mickey tried to 
                <br>grab the frog but it jumped again right into the kitchen sink. The sink was full of water and flowing onto 
                <br>the floor. Mickey said to the frog, “you really should look before you leap”.</p>

        <h2>Toodles Tells Mickey To Use A Lasso</h2>
        <p id="para-2">Toodles tells Mickey that lasso is the right tool. Mickey and Goofy carefully bring back the bicycle with the 
            <br>help of a lasso. Mickey then tells Goofy that they should look for a nice, safe pond for their friend, the 
            <br>frog, so he can jump around without causing any trouble. This made the frog very happy and he started
            <br>jumping up and down. <br><br><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSVxdXR3QsfdGD2GbO_Hx1-AoIl_jGOtf7LZg&s" 
            alt="pic3" height="250px" width="250px"><br>

            The frog then hopped away into town as Mickey and Goofy followed. The frog stopped in front of a
            <br>pizzeria and Goofy and Mickey came up behind him slowly. Mickey told Goofy that they should catch the
            <br>frog before he jumps again. But, it was too late.Just as Mickey was about to catch him, the frog jumped
            <br>again and landed in a pizza pie and made all the tomato sauce drip out. The man behind the counter at the 
            <br>pizzeria told the frog, “you should look before you leap”. The frog licked off the tomato sauce from its 
            <br>body and hopped off again towards where Minnie and Pluto were.</p>
            
            <h2>The Frog Jumps Into A Fish Bowl</h2>
            
            <p>Mickey told Goofy that maybe Minnie and Pluto could help them catch their frog friend. But, before 
                <br>anyone could do anything, the frog jumped into the goldfish bowl that Minnie was holding. The splash 
                <br>caused the goldfish to fly out of the bowl and Minnie quickly picked it up and put it back in the bowl. 
                <br>Goofy said that perhaps they wouldn’t be able to find a pond for the frog and that they might need help 
                <br>again. Mickey asked Toodles what they should use next. Toodles says that a net is the right tool for the 
                <br>task. <br><br><img src="https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/159810_40946-e1692394157916.jpg?w=1000&h=667&crop=1" 
                alt="pic4" height="250px" width="280px"><br>

                Finally, they were able to get the frog into the net but both Mickey and Goofy noticed that the frog had 
                <br>become sad. But almost instantly Mickey and the frog saw something in front of them that made them 
                <br>smile. All the friends walked quickly towards the fountain down the street and Mickey carefully placed the 
                <br>net on the ground. The frog needed no help and leaped out on his own directly into the fountain. In the 
                <br>fountain, he found another frog friend. “Ribbit ribbit” he said, and “ribbit ribbit” she said. Mickey said that
                 <br>maybe they didn’t find their frog friend a pond but they did find a place for him to splash around. Minnie 
                 <br>added they found the frog a friend, too, and they look very happy to see each other. <br><br><img src="https://ew.com/thmb/eO9gMuL4SARmWX0iaOxUUgHp8Zo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mickey-clubhouse_0-88521e9b3d8047a7b8edc91a803e1e4c.jpg" 
                 alt="pic5" height="250px" width="380px">
                
               <br>Later, when they all came back home, Donald, Minnie and Daisy made dinner while Mickey and Goofy 
                <br>went back to their game of chess. Mickey asked Goofy to hurry up as he hasn’t made a move in a long
                 <br>time and Goofy replied, “I know, I know, I just want to make sure I look carefully before I leap!”</p>

        <p>Moral of the story: Mickey Mouse’s adventures with his friends always come with a moral or a lesson
            <br> attached with it. It helps little children make smarter, wiser choices and better decisions. The moral of this 
            <br> story is before we do something that looks exciting or we are very excited to do something, we must stop 
            <br> and consider how safe it is. “Look before you leap” means to be careful before doing anything risky. <br><br><img src="https://static.tnn.in/thumb/msid-92742810,thumbsize-76018,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/92742810.jpg"
